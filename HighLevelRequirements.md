# Money transfer website



User can signup for an account
Choose where they want to send money to 
enter their information and tranfer amount and the receiver's information
That information is sent to receiver's country, where they can go retrieve the money at a given location



The application should generate a comprehensive report detailing how many transactions were made
during a specific time frame.
Keep track of the exchange rate at which every transaction was made, and tell the admin, if based on
previous transactions they should send money at current market exchange rate, and if not it 
should suggest an exchange rate based on past transactions.
